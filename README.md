# Minishell Project

This is the 42 Berlin School `minishell` project, written by [author 1][author 2], in accordance with the version number [version number] of the subject [include subject and link]. This project does not cover the bonus part of the subject.

## About the Subject

The `minishell` project requires students to develop a simple clone of Bash. It is also the first group project of the 42 Core Curriculum. From these two statements, we can easily identify the main challenges and goals of the task:

- Acquire a deep understanding of Bash inner workings.
- Coordinate work with your teammate. We believe that without properly addressing and planning for these two challenges from the very beginning, `minishell` will quickly turn into what a lot of students call "minihell."

### Understanding Bash

Released in 1989, Bash has by now acquired almost mythical status. It is a universal tool that every programmer should feel, at the very least, acquainted with, if not properly comfortable. Therefore, sources at your disposal are plenty. If you are a 42 student, we advise you to search Slack for resources provided by fellow students over the years. Be aware, the `minishell` subject has changed over time, so not all advice is relevant. Here is a list of some of the most mentioned and useful links:

- SOURCES

In our experience, no amount of reading will actually prepare you for some of Bash's more obscure behaviors. And although a lot of them are out of the scope of the project, there's still plenty that needs to be considered, even if, like us, you do not go for the bonus. We encountered a lot of these difficult cases while testing our almost finished project. This is the most stressful way of discovering them. Luckily, by then our program was solid enough to withstand most of them.
