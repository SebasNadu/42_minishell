<h1 id="minishell-project">minishell project</h1>
<p>This is the 42 Berlin School <code>minishell</code> prject, written by [author 1][author 2], in accordance with the version number [version nbr] of the subject [include subject and link]. This project does not cover the bonus part of the subject.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-subject">About the subject</h2>
<p>The <code>minishell</code> project requires students to develope a simple clone of Bash. It is also the first group project of the 42 Core Curriculum. From these two statements we can easily identify the main challenges and goals of the task:</p>
<ul>
<li>aquire a deep understanding of Bash inner workings.</li>
<li>coordinate work with your teammate.
We believe that without properly addressing and planning for these two challenges from the very beggining, <code>minishell</code> will quickly turn into what a lot of students call &quot;minihell&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-bash">Understanding Bash</h3>
<p>Released in 1989, Bash has by now aquired almost mitical status. It is a universal tool that every programmer should feel, at the very least, acquainted with, if not properly comfortable. Therefore, sources at your disposal are plenty.
If you are a 42 student, we advise you to search Slack for resources provided by fellow students over the years. Be aware, the <code>minishell</code> subject has changed over time so not all advise is relevant. Here is a list of some of the most mentioned and usefull links:</p>
<ul>
<li>SOURCES</li>
</ul>
<p>In our experience, no amount of reading will actually prepare you for some of BashÂ´s more obscure behaviours. And although a lot of them are out of scope of the project, theres still plenty that need to be considered, even if, like us, you do not go for bonus.
We encountered a lot of these difficult cases while testing our almost finished project. This is the most stresfull way of discovering them. Luckily, by then our program was solid enough to widthstand most of them. </p>
